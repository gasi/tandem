## About ##
[tandem](http://tandem.gasi.ch/) is an exploration of [Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface) and other concepts of Human-Computer Interaction to improve the way we explore the [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) universe. Too complicated? Just think of it this way: «[tandem](http://tandem.gasi.ch/) makes [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) more awesome.»
